**Abstract**:

A marginal sea in the north eastern Indian Ocean, the Andaman Sea, has been known for the presence of high-amplitude internal waves since the nineteenth century. In this study, we explored the interannual variations of the internal wave activity in this complex region. We found that the Dipole Mode Index, which represents the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), influences the circulation in the Andaman Sea, which in turn impacts its density stratification on interannual scales. Ocean Reanalysis System 5 data (1993â€“2018) is used to see an increasing trend in the sub-surface stratification, whereas it showed a decreasing trend in the near-surface waters. Numerical model simulations carried out from 2009 to 2018 have shown that the interannual variability in the generation of semidiurnal internal tides is governed by distinct parameters (tidal forcing and stratification) at different sites in different months. Enhanced upwelling (downwelling) is observed during positive (negative) IOD events. Sensitivity experiments conducted between extreme IOD events (2006 and 2016) revealed an increase in internal tide generation from positive IOD to negative IOD. Furthermore, a sharp decrease in local baroclinic dissipation is seen during negative IOD, increasing baroclinic flux into the Andaman Sea. An increase in the strength of positive IOD could lead to enhanced diapycnal mixing due to strong local dissipation, whereas an increase in the intensity of negative IOD could result in amplified propagation of internal waves.
