# Hi! üëãüèΩ

I'm B. Yadidya.

I'm currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with [Prof. Brian K. Arbic](https://arbic.earth.lsa.umich.edu) in the [Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences](https://lsa.umich.edu/earth), [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu), Ann Arbor. \
My research focuses on leveraging high-resolution data-assimilative [HYCOM](https://www.hycom.org/) simulations in conjunction with satellite altimetry, including the newly launched [SWOT](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/) satellite, to map and understand the global internal wave field.

<u>Project title</u>: "Diagnosis and Validation of the Time and Spatial Variability of Remotely Generated Internal Waves in Global Ocean Simulations".



I received my PhD from the [Centre for Atmospheric Sciences](https://cas.iitd.ac.in/), [Indian Insitute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) in January 2023.
I worked on the **"Variability of Internal waves in the Andaman Sea"** under the supervision of [Prof. A. D. Rao](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~adrao/) and [Prof. Vimlesh Pant](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~vimlesh/).
During my PhD, I've looked at the variability of internal waves across multiple timescales ranging from [diurnal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90426-w), [seasonal](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JC018321), [interannual](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15301-8) to [climate](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00574-8) scales in one of the hotspot regions for large-amplitude internal waves - the Andaman Sea. 
My PhD was funded by the Department of Science and Technology, India under the INSPIRE fellowship.
